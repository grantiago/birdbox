~~192.168.1.7 has the standard esp32 streaming webserver installed dead. 
  I shorted this on connecting the leads. Whoops.~~


for the example esp32 webserver stream from the arduino ide examples over http 
http://192.168.x.xx:81/stream the stream without clicking on the start stream.

#### ffmpeg
See the .sh file. This actually works with the arduino E14 sketch and the ESP32 cam. I had a diffucult time finding info on the esp32 cam streaming to youtube.   
I found the answer by setting the search to -- ffmpeg to youtube site:stackoverflow.com   
Then I spent a day punching through the ffmpeg options. 

The esp32 video is identified by ffmpeg as follows: 

    Stream #0:0: Video: mjpeg (Baseline),
    yuvj422p(pc, bt470bg/unknown/unknown),
    800x600 [SAR 1:1 DAR 4:3],
    9.90 fps,
    9.90 tbr,
    90k tbn,
    90k tbc
